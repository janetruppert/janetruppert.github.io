I am a privacy researcher, evaluator, and advocate graduating in May 2023 with my PhD in [Information Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience) from the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu). I study how young people understand privacy with [Ricarose Roque](https://www.ricarose.com/) in the [Creative Communities Research Group](https://www.creativecommunities.group/) and [Ben Shapiro](https://benshapi.ro/) in the [Laboratory for Playful Computation](https://www.playfulcomputation.group/). Additionally, I produce quantitative and written analyses of privacy as an evaluator for [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/)'s [Privacy Program](https://privacy.commonsense.org/). Previously, I earned my B.S. in Management Information Systems from the [Department of Information Systems, Statistics and Management Science](https://catalog.ua.edu/undergraduate/commerce-business-administration/information-systems-statistics-management-science/) at the [University of Alabama](https://www.ua.edu/) in 2018.
