I am a privacy researcher, evaluator, and advocate. Currently, I work as a Privacy Analyst at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/privacy/), where I review and analyze requests to collect, store, and use people's data. I finished my Ph.D. in [Information Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience) from [CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu) in 2023, where I worked with young people to learn how they understand privacy. I was advised by [Ricarose Roque](https://www.ricarose.com/), a member of the [Creative Communities Research Group](https://www.creativecommunities.group/), and worked with [Ben Shapiro](https://benshapi.ro/). 

As an evaluator with [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/)'s [Privacy Program](https://privacy.commonsense.org/), I audited popular technologies according to technical and legal standards. Previously, I earned my B.S. in Management Information Systems from the [Department of Information Systems, Statistics and Management Science](https://catalog.ua.edu/undergraduate/commerce-business-administration/information-systems-statistics-management-science/) at the [University of Alabama](https://www.ua.edu/).
