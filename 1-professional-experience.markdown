I have experience in privacy evaluation and mitigation, education, and web development. In my current role, I work with teams across Apple to evaluate data collection requests and apply privacy-preserving techniques. In the past, I have worked as a Privacy Policy Evaluator with [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/)’s [Privacy Program](https://privacy.commonsense.org/), performing quantitative evaluations of legal policies and publishing written summaries to the program’s website. 

I have taught several sections of Computational Reasoning I, an undergraduate Python computing course, as a teaching assistant and the primary instructor. 

As an undergraduate in 2017, I worked at the University of Alabama’s brand-new [Technology Accessibility Initiative](https://accessibility.ua.edu/) as an accessibility evaluator, using tools to audit university websites according to [WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

I also worked for the University of Alabama’s [Office of Information Technology](https://oit.ua.edu/) as a student web developer and later by the [Housing and Residential Communities](https://housing.sa.ua.edu/) where I developed a work order submission form using Laravel, PHP, and XAMPP database tools.
