I have strong personal commitments to justice, which I enact through sustained community engagement in my research and personal work. 

In my research, I took a participatory, community-based research approach, working with educators as co-researchers. I was a [Community Based Research Graduate Fellow](https://www.colorado.edu/cuengage/graduate-fellowship-community-based-research-0/) 2021-22.

As an undergraduate, I planned and led service trips at the [Center for Service and Leadership](https://leadandserve.sa.ua.edu/) for two years. 

After I joined CU as a PhD student, I helped to found [United Campus Workers of Colorado](https://www.ucwcolorado.org/), our CU labor union. In 2020, I was elected to the Steering Committee and then elected union secretary, where I served for one year. 

I also previously organized on a weekly basis with [SAFE Boulder](https://safeboulder.org/), a mutual aid group.
