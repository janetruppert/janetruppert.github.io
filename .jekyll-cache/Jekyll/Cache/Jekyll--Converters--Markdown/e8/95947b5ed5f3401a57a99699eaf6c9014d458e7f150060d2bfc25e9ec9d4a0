I"Þ<p>I have strong personal commitments to justice, which I enact through sustained community engagement in my research and personal work.</p>

<p>I approach research partnerships with a participatory, community-based research approach, working with educators as co-researchers. I was a <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cuengage/graduate-fellowship-community-based-research-0/">Community Based Research Graduate Fellow</a> 2021-22.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate, I planned and led service trips at the <a href="https://leadandserve.sa.ua.edu/">Center for Service and Leadership</a> for two years.</p>

<p>After I joined CU as a PhD student, I helped to found <a href="https://www.ucwcolorado.org/">United Campus Workers of Colorado</a>, our CU labor union. In 2020, I was elected to the Steering Committee and then elected union secretary, where I served for one year.</p>

<p>I also organize on a weekly basis with <a href="https://safeboulder.org/">SAFE Boulder</a>, a mutual aid group.</p>
