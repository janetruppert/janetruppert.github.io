<p>I am a privacy researcher, evaluator, and advocate. Currently, I work as a Privacy Analyst at <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple</a>, where I review and analyze requests to collect, store, and use people’s data. I finished my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience">Information Science</a> from <a href="https://www.colorado.edu">CU Boulder</a> in 2023, where I worked with young people to learn how they understand privacy. I was advised by <a href="https://www.ricarose.com/">Ricarose Roque</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.creativecommunities.group/">Creative Communities Research Group</a>, and worked with <a href="https://benshapi.ro/">Ben Shapiro</a>.</p>

<p>As an evaluator with <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common Sense Media</a>’s <a href="https://privacy.commonsense.org/">Privacy Program</a>, I audited popular technologies according to technical and legal standards. Previously, I earned my B.S. in Management Information Systems from the <a href="https://catalog.ua.edu/undergraduate/commerce-business-administration/information-systems-statistics-management-science/">Department of Information Systems, Statistics and Management Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ua.edu/">University of Alabama</a>.</p>
