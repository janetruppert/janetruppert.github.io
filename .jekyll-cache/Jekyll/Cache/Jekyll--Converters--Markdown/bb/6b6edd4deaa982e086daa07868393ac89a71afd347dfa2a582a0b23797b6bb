I"ô<p>I design and manage qualitative studies end-to-end. In particular, I have experience with interview, ethnographic, and community-based research methods.</p>

<p>Since 2020, I have been leading research with teenagers on topics of digital privacy through interviews and <a href="https://www.ajl.org/drag-vs-ai">Drag vs. AI</a> workshops.</p>

<p>During this time, I was a <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cuengage/graduate-fellowship-community-based-research-0/">Community Based Research Graduate Fellow</a> with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cuengage/">CU Engageâ€™s Center for Community-Based Learning and Research</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also served as the Graduate Research Assistant on an interview study of family digital privacy with the <a href="https://fpf.org/future-privacy-forum-education-innovation-foundation/">Future of Privacy Forum Education and Innovation Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.familycreativelearning.org/">Family Creative Learning</a> research project in 2018.</p>

<p>I first fell in love with qualitative research after working at the <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/academics/graduate/phd/hcc/">University of Floridaâ€™s Human-Centered Computing department</a> with <a href="https://learndialogue.org/person.php?id=keboyer">Kristy Boyer</a> and the <a href="https://learndialogue.org/">LearnDialogue research group</a> as an undergraduate in the summer of 2017.</p>

<p>Much of my work has been published and presented at computing, HCI, and educational academic venues.</p>
