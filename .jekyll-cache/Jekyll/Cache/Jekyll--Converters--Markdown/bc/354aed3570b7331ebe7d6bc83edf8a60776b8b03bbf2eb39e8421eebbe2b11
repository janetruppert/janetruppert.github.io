<p>I am a privacy researcher, evaluator, and advocate. I finished my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience">Information Science</a> from <a href="https://www.colorado.edu">CU Boulder</a>, where I worked with young people to learn how they understand privacy. I was advised by <a href="https://www.ricarose.com/">Ricarose Roque</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.creativecommunities.group/">Creative Communities Research Group</a>, and worked with <a href="https://benshapi.ro/">Ben Shapiro</a>. As an evaluator with <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common Sense Media</a>â€™s <a href="https://privacy.commonsense.org/">Privacy Program</a>, I audited popular technologies according to technical and legal standards. Previously, I earned my B.S. in Management Information Systems from the <a href="https://catalog.ua.edu/undergraduate/commerce-business-administration/information-systems-statistics-management-science/">Department of Information Systems, Statistics and Management Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ua.edu/">University of Alabama</a>.</p>
