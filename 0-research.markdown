I design and manage qualitative studies end-to-end. In particular, I have experience with interview, ethnographic, and community-based research methods.

Since 2020, I have been leading research with teenagers on topics of digital privacy through interviews and [Drag vs. AI](https://www.ajl.org/drag-vs-ai) workshops. 

During this time, I was a [Community Based Research Graduate Fellow](https://www.colorado.edu/cuengage/graduate-fellowship-community-based-research-0/) with [CU Engage’s Center for Community-Based Learning and Research](https://www.colorado.edu/cuengage/). 

I’ve also served as the Graduate Research Assistant on an interview study of family digital privacy with the [Future of Privacy Forum Education and Innovation Foundation](https://fpf.org/future-privacy-forum-education-innovation-foundation/) and the [Family Creative Learning](https://www.familycreativelearning.org/) research project in 2018. 

I first fell in love with qualitative research after working at the [University of Florida’s Human-Centered Computing department](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/academics/graduate/phd/hcc/) with [Kristy Boyer](https://learndialogue.org/person.php?id=keboyer) and the [LearnDialogue research group](https://learndialogue.org/) as an undergraduate in the summer of 2017.
  
Much of my work has been published and presented at computing, HCI, and educational academic venues.
